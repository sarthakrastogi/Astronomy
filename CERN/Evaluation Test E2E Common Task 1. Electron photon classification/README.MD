# End-to-End Deep Learning Project Common Task 1. Electron/Photon Classification



**Author:** Sarthak Rastogi

I implemented two CNNs to classify 498,000 data samples of 32x32 matrices with two channels each, into two classes: electrons and photons.

# Problem Statement

Common Task 1. Electron/photon classification

Datasets:

https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/AtBT8y4MiQYFcgc (photons)

https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/FbXw3V4XNyYB3oA (electrons)

Description: 32x32 matrices (two channels - hit energy and time) for two classes of
particles electrons and photons impinging on a calorimeter

Please use a deep learning method of your choice to achieve the highest possible
classification on this dataset (we ask that you do it both in Keras/Tensorflow and in
PyTorch). Please provide a Jupyter notebook that shows your solution.
