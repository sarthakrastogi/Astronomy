# Problem Statement

Specific Task 2. Jets as Graphs

Description:

● Choose 2 Graph-based architectures of your choice to classify jets as being
quarks or gluons. Provide a description on what considerations you have taken to
project this point-cloud dataset to a set of interconnected nodes and edges.

● Discuss the resulting performance of the 2 chosen architectures.
Datasets: use either https://zenodo.org/record/3164691#.YElKBy0RqJ9 or
https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/hqz8zE7oxyPjvsL depending on your preference of
dataset format. Please mention the dataset you are using in your jupyter notebook
which you will be finally submitting.
